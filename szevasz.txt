##ez amikor már megvan a repo a gépünkön, és abba akarunk pusholni
# assumption: a project called `repo` already exists on the machine, and a new branch has been pushed to GitHub.com since the last time changes were made locally
cd repo
# update all remote tracking branches, and the currently checked out branch
git pull
# change into the existing branch called `feature-a`
git checkout feature-a
git add file1.md
# take a snapshot of the staging area
git commit -m "edit file1"
git push
